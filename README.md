# palm-kb-websearch

This project is a RESTful web service built with Node.js, TypeScript, and Express designed to be a knowledge base provider for [Booz Allen PALM](https://github.com/boozallen/palm). It uses the public web to fulfill requests, with the potential to be expanded into a tool for providing data from private sources.

## This Is A Toy

Created mostly to play with GitHub Copilot and is *NOT intended for production use*.

## Environment

Environment variables for development/deployment:

- `GCP_API_KEY`: Google Cloud API Key
- `GCP_CSE_ID`: Google Cloud Custom Search WEngine ID

## Development

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run in development mode: `npm run dev`
- Build TypeScript: `npm run build`
- Start production server: `npm start`

## Docker

To build and run the Docker image:

```sh
docker build -t palm-kb-websearch .
docker run -p 3000:3000 palm-kb-websearch
```

The service will be available at http://localhost:3000/

## TODO

- The project was 99% generated by running GitHub Copilot Chat Agent requests, and minimal ones. As such it needs refactoring, documentation.
- Implement fetching the original page and providing larger/multiple context chunks to the client.
- Expand to implement multiple search engine APIs; such as Bing, Duck Duck Go, and possibly Sharepoint (could be useful as a private data source).
